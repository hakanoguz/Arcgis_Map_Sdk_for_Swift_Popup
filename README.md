# ArcgisMapSdkSwiftPopup

Many web maps contain predefined popups which are used to display the attributes associated with each feature layer in the map, such as hiking trails, land values, or unemployment rates. You can display text, attachments, images, charts, and web links. Rather than creating new popups to display information, you can easily access and display the predefined popups.
